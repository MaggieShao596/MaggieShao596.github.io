  ### Project 1: Sex Differences in Obesity Predictors  
*Sep 2025 – Dec 2025*

This project analyzes obesity-related health data to identify key predictors of BMI and examine how these factors differ across sex using exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical methods.

Calories burned during workouts show a weak relationship with BMI across genders, suggesting BMI is influenced by multiple factors beyond exercise alone.
